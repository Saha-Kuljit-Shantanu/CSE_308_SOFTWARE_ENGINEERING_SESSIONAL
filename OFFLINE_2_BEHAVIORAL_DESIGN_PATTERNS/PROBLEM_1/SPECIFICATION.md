ABC Company provides #server as a service to its clients. But asthe company is very new and small,
currently they have only one server. So, when maintenance or upgrading work is carried out, the
server maybe partially or fully down. The company has two types of clients: premium user and
regular user. Premium users must pay more than the regular users and in return, they receive
some benefits. As a part of an agreement, all the data of the premium users are backed up in a
server of DEF Company. When the server of ABC Company is partially down (some functionalities
are not available) or fully down, DEF Company helps to provide an uninterrupted service.
