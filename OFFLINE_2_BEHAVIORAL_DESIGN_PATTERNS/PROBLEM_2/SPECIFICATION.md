Exam controller office plays an important role in arranging exams. In a university, the examiners send all the exam scripts and corresponding marksheets to the exam controller office after checking the exam scripts. The exam controller office scrutinizes the marks and correct mistakes(if any). Then it publishes the results to the students. If a student thinks that he/she should have got more marksin an exam than he/she got, he/she can apply forre-examine. The examcontroller office then sends the corresponding exam script to the corresponding teacher. The teacher re-examines the script and let the exam controller office know if there is any change (increase or
decrease) in marks. The exam controller office then lets the student know the results of re-examine and update the mark if there is any change.
