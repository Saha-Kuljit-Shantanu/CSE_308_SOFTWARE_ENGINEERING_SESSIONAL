black coffee. On the other hand, cappuccino is a type of milk coffee prepared by adding cinnamon
powder to regular milk coffee. Mocha also is a type of milk coffee prepared by adding chocolate
sauce to regular milk coffee. As you may know, black coffee is prepared with water and grinded
coffee beans whereas milk coffee is prepared with milk and grinded coffee beans.

**কফির টং** serves the coffee in their handmade fancy coffee mugs, each of which costs 100 taka.
The amounts of grinded coffee beans and milk, if required, added to each cup of coffee cost 30
taka and 50 taka, respectively. Besides, the amounts of dairy cream, cinnamon powder, and
chocolate sauce added to different types of coffee cost 40 taka, 50 taka, and 60 taka, respectively.
