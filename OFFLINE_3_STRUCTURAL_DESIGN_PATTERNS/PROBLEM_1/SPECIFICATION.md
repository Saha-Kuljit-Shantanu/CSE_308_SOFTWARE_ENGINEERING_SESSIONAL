In a spaceship, roaming from one galaxy to another galaxy, there are two types of passengers
onboard. Some of these passengers are called **Crewmates** and the other passengers are called
**Imposters**. **Crewmates** are the individuals who are **studying the interstellar objects** and
sometimes, **do basic maintenance tasks** of the spaceship. On the other hand, **imposters** are
actually space monsters, in disguise, who are attempting to **sabotage this voyage by poisoning the
crewmates** and **damaging the spaceship**. Recently, some of the crewmates have started to notice
strange behavior from some of the other passengers (who are imposters actually) while doing the
maintenance tasks together. To avoid suspicion, imposters have developed a device which helps
them damage the spaceship without looking **suspicious**.

Now, implement the above scenario by writing necessary classes and using appropriate design
pattern. You need not take inputs from the user in the solution of this problem. But, you have to
show the above scenario in one of your implemented classes by creating objects and calling
methods.
