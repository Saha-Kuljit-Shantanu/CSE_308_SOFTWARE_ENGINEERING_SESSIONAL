Assume that you have to implement a car manufacturing system for creating different types of
cars. Assume, there are three types of car companies including **Toyota**, **BMW**, **Tesla**. Your
system should be smart enough to identify the user's location and be careful about which
company to choose based on their **continental location**, i.e. choose Toyota if the location is any
Asian country, choose BMW if the location is any European country and Tesla for the United
States. Assume that the available colors for the car companies are respectively red, black and
white for Toyota, BMW, Tesla.

All the companies are dominated by **specific countries** (Toyota by Japan, BMW by Germany,
Tesla by US). Toyota uses hydrogen fuel cells for its engine whereas the other two companies
use electric engines. BMW and Toyota both use rear-wheel drive trains and Tesla uses all wheels
for drive trains.

You have to take input of the user's continental location. **The code should initialize the
appropriate country location of the manufacturer as customary according to the design pattern.**
You can create separate implementations for the **color**, **manufacturing country**, **engines** and
**drivetrain system** and finally print the details of the car including all information.
