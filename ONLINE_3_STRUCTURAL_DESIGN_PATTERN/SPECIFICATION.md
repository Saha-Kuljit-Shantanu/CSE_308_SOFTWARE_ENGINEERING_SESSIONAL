Suppose that you run a company, named **Orange**, that manufactures 2 (two) different types of
electronic devices, including **Notebook Computers** and **Smartphones**. Each of these two
devices has the following common functionalities.

● Users can store files in the Storage Module of a device.
● Users can interact with the device via its Interface Module.
● Users can communicate among one another using the Communication Module of a device.

However, in order to facilitate these functionalities, an **Operating System** is required in the
manufactured electronic device. An operating system comes with the aforementioned 3 (three)
modules that enable the corresponding functionalities in a device. **Windoors** and **Linus** are 2
(two) companies that manufacture operating systems in the market. The electronic devices,
manufactured at Orange, must have the facility to replace the current operating system with a
different operating system, at any time, to maximize the user satisfaction.
Now, you have to implement necessary classes, following an appropriate design pattern, to
capture the scenario above. For the sake of simplicity, you may just print out the type of the
functionality, the name of the module involved, and the name of the operating system used when
implementing a method for a particular functionality of an electronic device
